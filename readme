Project: 8 Channel PWM Receiver (ESP32 + ExpressLRS)

Description:
This project implements an 8-channel PWM receiver using an ESP32 microcontroller.
It receives control data from an ExpressLRS (ELRS) Nano receiver via CRSF protocol
and outputs standard PWM signals for use with ESCs, servos, or motor drivers.

Hardware Used:
- ESP32 Development Board
- RP1 ExpressLRS Nano Receiver V2
- Jumper wires and power supply

Features:
- 8 PWM output channels
- CRSF protocol decoding
- Signal fail-safe protection
- Smooth output mapping

How to Upload:
1. Open the file "8_channel_pwm_receiver.ino" in Arduino IDE.
2. Select the correct ESP32 board and COM port.
3. Click “Upload”.
4. Connect your ExpressLRS receiver via UART (RX/TX).

Default UART Pins (changeable in code):
- RX → GPIO16
- TX → GPIO17
